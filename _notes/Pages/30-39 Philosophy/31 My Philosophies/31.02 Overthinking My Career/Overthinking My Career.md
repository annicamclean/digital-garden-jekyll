title: Overthinking My Career
---
Do I overthink what I want to do with my life?

It is just a question I constantly ask myself as I reach the end of my college career. I kind of wonder if I have chosen the right path for myself. I mean I have been doing coding and programming since I was in 8th grade, and I do enjoy making things. But I also question if I really want to do this for the rest of my working life.

I think many young people have this problem. They want to something big with their life. Though they don't know what it should be. Which leads them to overthink about what they should be doing.

Many feel unmotivated to create things outside of themselves. Often asking what is the point to all of it. What is the point to working towards something if in the end we all pass away. It is sort of a never ending cycle. Of feeling like you should be doing more, but not realizing what that more is.

Often times struggling to find jobs and internships using their degree. Maybe due to the job market right now. Going into a career every says to go into that becomes oversaturated. Or just not putting in enough effort to get a job using their degree, if they have one. It is pretty disheartening to struggle to get a job or an internship. 

The young people who do have a degree don't want to do all of the classes involved with a degree. Like gen eds and even parts of their degree. I know of many people who hate having to take the theory classes when it comes to my degree. And of course that is just something that comes with the degree and there is nothing you can really do about it.

In the end doing things you don't enjoy is just apart of life. If you enjoyed everything you did in life then it would be highly boring. There wouldn't be any joy if everything is joyful and exciting.

And of course many young people have other hobbies outside of their job or the degree they are working towards. So it may make sense to just keep your job completely separate from your hobbies. Maybe stop letting your job be considered fun and just let it be its name, a job.

I see this a lot with YouTubers who enjoyed doing YouTube and had it only as a hobby. Then they learned that they could live of the money they made from YouTube. Then they started to hate YouTube because it turned from this little hobby to a job that they had to do in order to survive.

It could also be that young people just don't have enough experience to really enjoy a job. I mean there of course is the 10,000 hour rule that says it takes 10,000 hours to be a master of something. Most young people just haven't racked up the hours to get there. I mean it is hard, especially when you don't know what to do and as the world becomes (more distracting). Go check out my article [[A Semester Without Social Media]]. 

This overthinking could of course be caused by not being in the field that they want to work in. Maybe if young people actually got to use the skills they have/had been learning in college and actually applied that to a job they may enjoy it more. Not to mention they probably wouldn't feel like they have been wasting their 3 to 5 years in college.

And maybe that is just a sunken cost fallacy or a bad case of senioritis. It could be a lack of purpose that is making young people feel this way. I mean I haven't felt a real purpose in life since high school. So that could be the reason why others my be feeling this anxiety around going into a career they don't have strong feelings for anymore.

But I don't believe that it is anxiety. Usually you can figure out the problem that is causing the anxiety. Unless the problem is unfixable, then it might be anxiety around all of it.

Maybe it is something we wont know until we grow up. I mean I am still young compared to most people's standards of an older person. And I haven't really lived life, so I truly don't know yet.

I guess I will just have to live some more. Because while other people's ideas are a great staring point, they are the end all be all of how you should live your life. They are really just suggestions that have worked for them.

I guess the only way to truly know is to live some more. While other people's ideas on how to live are great, it just takes time to actually know how you want to live your life. All of their advice is truly just suggestions on how you should live because you are not them, and their advice may not be helpful to you at all.

Maybe the real thing that is making me overthink is how much time I have spent alive. I haven't spent a lot of time on Earth and I might not have gotten that overview of my life. Years still feel like a long time and time just moves so slow when you are younger. The thing could be that getting older allows you to realize how fast time truly moves. When you have less of it.

All of this to say I truly don't know what to do right now. I cannot tell if I am living through a sunken cost fallacy or just to young to understand. If I have heard to much advice on how to live or not enough to enjoy life. Or am I just overthinking my future job right now and should just suck it up and tough it out.
