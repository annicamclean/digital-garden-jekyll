title: The Rented World

 >You'll own nothing and you'll be happy
> ~ Ida Auken

This quote lives rent free in my head. It comes from a famous essay titled  *"Welcome to 2030. I own nothing, have no privacy, and life has never been better"* later retitled [*"Here's how life could change in my city by the year 2030"*](https://web.archive.org/web/20201120092841/https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/how-life-could-change-2030/) . Auken talks about a world in which everything in life is rented and when we are not using something like our house or appliances, it is being rented to someone else.

While the year is not 2030 and I don't live Denmark, the thoughts and ideas of the article are becoming ever more present in today's society. In this article I'm going to talk about why we rent, what we rent, and the effects of renting. So first let me start of with the question where did renting come from?

Back during sometime maybe Mesopotamia maybe Europe during feudalism and the medieval time period, people rented from others. Weather it was just a contract that says that you can live here if you pay me the idea of renting has be around for a very longtime. As humans we have gotten use to the idea of living somewhere and not owning it. But it begs the question why do we rent anyways?

## Why rent?

> When you rent you are paying someone else's mortgage

The quote above is something many Americans love to espouse to others. My thoughts on the quote is that is is true, you are paying someone else mortgage, but so what? People pay for other people's things all the time, it is how money works. Also renting has many benefits makes sense for a lot of people. 

Think of many young people who don't have the money to buy a house or a condo. Most young people haven't found the place they want to live in for the rest of their lives, or at least for a little while. It just wouldn't make sense for them to buy especially sense it cost a lot of time, money, and effort to buy and sell a house. And if you sell a house to early you will be losing money on the house.

There are also many famous streamers who rent out places. Renting allows them a sense of security, because if their address is ever leaked online they can just leave in a year or two so it doesn't have too much of an effect. 

Like mentioned before there are many people who rent because it is just less of a hassle. [Ramit Sethi](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/) talks about how with renting your only expense is the rent, but with a mortgage it is your first expense. I mean you have to pay when something breaks, property taxes, other taxes, maybe for and HOA and so much more when you own a house. I think that people love to omit the downsides of owning a house and only focus on owning something part. 

The idea of renting places is to save money and allow you the freedom to move to different places. But places aren't the only things we rent.

Renting in other capacities has its merits like boat or a bigger car to have a family road trip. And while these good use cases exist many bad ones also exist. Which brings me to main topic I wanted to talk about, **subscriptions**.

## Subscriptions Suck

Listen I am not a subscription hater, but they just have to make sense. Like why would I pay for a subscription and a product. Or why would I pay for the subscription if most of the content is not very good. Or why would I buy a subscription for a product that I don't even know if I will like. It is these types of subscriptions that make me ask why am I paying so much for shoddy products.

Many of these companies will say "Oh well you need to pay for the subscription to get the full use of the product" or "Our service needs the subscription because we have to update or app". The thing is I know a product never cost as much as the seller charges including labor, so then where is that extra money going to. I let you take a guess.

Companies may also say "Well it gives you so many things to watch", and that seems like a good thing, but is it. The over abundance of content makes it hard to really watch anything and you really end up not really watching anything. Then you are left paying for something you not actually using. Which is of course lining the pockets of the higher ups and leaving you more broke.

A company may also say something like "Well we have to pay our employees somehow" or "We gave out a free trial so why can't you decide". First lets start with the free trial argument, a 7 day free trial is not enough to really know if you like a product. You haven't even created a habit of using the product, so you don't even know if you are going to use it. You may start to hate using the product after the week of use. Or you could have found an app that works better and now you spent a monthly payment (I'm assuming not a year) on something you stopped using after the trial period. 

The second comment of well how else will we pay our employees is easy, ads. I know so many companies like to say we don't run ads, but then at the same time will sell our information to anyone who is buying. So you might as well run ads. There is no reason not to unless your company is built on the idea of privacy which almost all aren't.

## Subscription Effects

What are the effects of all these subscriptions? The most obvious is that you are paying a lot for products. Lets say you are paying $8 a month for a subscription, it will only take 13 subscriptions to pay over $100 a month. Which may not seem like a lot for some people, but then you remember that's $1200 a year and most American don't have $1000 to pay for an unexpected emergency. 

A second effect is that companies without subscriptions are making worse products. The thought process behind the company is well we have to make money somehow, so they make the products cheaper. Meaning that the consumer is paying the same if not more for an really bad product.

So it begs the question "What are we doing?" Well, we can only control a company if we don't give them our money. So the easiest thing to do is to not give them our money. The second easiest thing to do is to be highly selective about what you get a subscription to. The hardest thing would be to create a company with the ideals of making good products without a subscription.

What will most do though. Absolutely nothing. I mean it is easier to just let thing be how they are and hope for the best. To just ignore what I have said because in the end I am just a random person on the internet. So I may just talking into a void, but I have put my thoughts out there. And hopefully we wont reach a completely rented world.
