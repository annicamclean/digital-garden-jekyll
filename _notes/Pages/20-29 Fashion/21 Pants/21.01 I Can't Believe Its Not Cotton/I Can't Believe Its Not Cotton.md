title: I Can't Believe Its Not Cotton

Clothes shouldn't have as much plastic as they do nowadays. 

Every time I look for a jacket, it has plastic. When I look for pants, plastic. Even (a supposedly) cotton t-shirts have plastic in it.

So then I started to ask why I couldn't find articles of clothing without plastic.

I decided to answer three different questions. First. why was plastic created in the first place? Second, why do so many pieces of clothing have plastic in it? Especially when it comes to women's clothing that is sub $100. Third who is at fault, for our plastic way of life?

## A Simple Billiard Ball 

Could you believe that billiard balls would be the reason we have plastic today?

Back in 1868 John Wesley Hyatt created celluloid, the first plastic in history. It was to replace having ivory in billiard balls. Celluloid was also used in for photos, film for movies, and in combs.

As time went on new forms of plastic were being created. There was Bakelite, cellulose acetate, polystyrene, Styrofoam, polyethylene, Teflon, and Kevlar. So many different types of plastic for different needs of the consumer. Making a post World War II era filled with consumption.

The main plastics we see today in clothes are polyester, spandex, nylon, acrylic, elastane, and polyamide. All come with their own use case. Each one was created to either replace or "strengthen" or clothes. But none are very good for our environment.

## Plastic is Destroying Our World

Yes, yes. Time and time again we hear that plastic is destroying our world and is not good for anybody or thing on this planet. The only people who don't know that are climate change deniers and children.

The thing about plastic is that it last for a very long time. To be more specific about 10,000 years. Which seems like an awful thing in today's time. But back when it was created people loved the idea of something lasting for such a long time.

The idea of something lasting forever is a good idea. And so many people thought of plastic as the be all end all material. The only problem is you can't make money from things lasting forever. It is an awful business model. 

## Plastic Defeated Its Own Purpose

The thing about plastic is that as mentioned before it last for hundreds of generations. The second thing about plastic is that companies got really good at making plastic, making it inexpensive to create. The thing about companies is that they love to make money.

Combine all of those things together and you get poorly built plastic. Not made to last more than a few uses before breaking. And having to buy a replacement for the item, which of course is plastic. Keeping the cycle going forever.

Almost everything that is made has touched something plastic. From the food that we eat being packaged in plastic. To our phone being surrounded by a plastic case. To our clothing that should be plastic free having the stitching made out of a plastic.

> Everything the light touches is plastic

## I Didn't Order Plastic

There are a few things in life that I try to always do. I try to keep my promises, I try not to be a hypocrite, and I try to live by rules that I set for myself. So I try to follow [[My Buying Philosophy]] when it comes to clothing. The only problem is things are made poorly.

When I go looking for pants for women that are not over $100, the pickings are slim. Every time I look for just on pair of pants that isn't made with any plastic, I just can't find them. And of course I can just save up for a more expensive pair, but why?

Why do I need to buy a pair of pants that are over $100 (that is not sweatpants) for me to avoid having plastic in my clothing. Especially since I can find men's pants that are sub $100 and made of a higher quality. I just don't want to pay more for styles that I didn't ask for and made with worse products. And I believe many others have that same feeling.

## So, Who is At Fault?

Everybody is at fault, but a bigger emphasis is on companies. 

I know it's over played to say that companies take a bigger blame, but they pretty much do. They don't have to use plastic in their clothing they just choose to. The items that it ships in doesn't have to be package in plastic. There are always better options for how companies do things.

The thing is a company, especially publicly traded companies, only incentive is to make more money than last year. So why would they not use plastic. It is super cheap and can make the garment "stronger" while keeping it the same price, which consumers love.

Which is why some of this over consumption of plastic is consumers faults as well. How did we get to the point were clothes don't last more than a few months. Why do we pay so little for items that should last at least a lifetime. I think it sort of shows how detached we have become to the items that we own.
