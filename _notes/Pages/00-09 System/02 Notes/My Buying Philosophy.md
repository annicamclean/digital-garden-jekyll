title: My Buying Philosophy
---
My Buying Philosophy is just used to make sure I am only buying things within reason instead of just buying things randomly. 

## Watches
Watches can only be bought for very obviously special occasions.
- By very obvious I mean birth of a child, your wedding, new job or promotion, a decade birthday, a certain money goal reached, or a graduation.

## Vinyl Records
For vinyl records they need to be in 1 or more of the categories specified below:
1. You have to listen to the album on repeat
2. You have to like at least 25% of the songs on the album
3. The album brings back nostalgia
4. It is by an artist you really want to support

## Clothes
Clothing should be bought either through Black Friday weekend, or during a massive sale of 30% or more.
- With clothes they need to be of a high quality, made out of natural fabrics (cotton, wool, hemp, linen) or something like rayon, or it needs to be cheap enough that the price wont bother me (still cannot be mostly plastic). It also cannot be an awful company like Shein for example.
- The clothes must not have logos as well unless easily removeable or super small.
- Any clothes purchased must be worn daily or they will not be bought again (this only applies to the season they should be worn during)

## Non-Necessities 
Anything that is not a necessity, but wanted must be on the mind for a while before it is bought (at least a month). It also needs to be of high quality and preferably not made of plastic unless that is the only way it is made.

## Books
Books may be bought once a month, but must be pre-owned and can only buy 5-per month. Books can be bought non-preowned if the book needs to be read soon. None should be electronic. 

## Necessities
Anything that is a necessity like food or hygiene can be bought at anytime. If it is needed for work it is a necessity and if it is tech it falls under the non-necessity rule.

## Large Purchases
For large purchases they must follow these rules:
1. It must be well researched and no doubts in my mind
2. I must follow the principles set by others who know what they are talking about. Like the 20/3/8 for buying new cars (20% down, 3 years to pay it off, and at most 8% interest)
3. $5,000 or 1/4 of your investments (stocks, bonds, real estate) which ever is bigger, is considered a big purchase
4. Car payments should not exceed how much you invest a month
5. House, Car, and Student Loans should be your only debts
6. Making these payments should not stop you from your normal investing habit
7. You should have at least $10,000 or 6 months of expenses saved up. Which ever is bigger. 
	- The reason for $10,000 is about the cost of a car engine.
8. Any big purchase must be saved up for or save for the down payment (only for houses and cars)

These ideas do not apply to gifts. Gifts should only be saved up for.
