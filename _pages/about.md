## Who Am I?
Hi there

My name is Annica. I am currently a Computer Science major in my senior year of college. Hopefully out of college I will get a job working with my degree.

The created this digital garden to have a place to keep my writing online.

## Create Your Own Digital Garden
You can get the digital garden template for free from [here](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template)and here is a [step-by-step guide](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll)on how to set it up. The last part of the guide it says to put 
```
git push origin master
```

This has been changed and it needs to be 
```
git push origin main
```

But other than that everything is the same and pretty easy to follow.
